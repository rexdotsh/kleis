# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `bun x ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `bun x ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `bun x ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides robust linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `bun x ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.

## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is available in `opensrc/` for deeper understanding of implementation details.

See `opensrc/sources.json` for the list of available packages and their versions.

Use this source code when you need to understand how a package works internally, not just its types/interface.

### Fetching Additional Source Code

To fetch source code for a package or repository you need to understand, run:

```bash
npx opensrc <package>           # npm package (e.g., npx opensrc zod)
npx opensrc pypi:<package>      # Python package (e.g., npx opensrc pypi:requests)
npx opensrc crates:<package>    # Rust crate (e.g., npx opensrc crates:serde)
npx opensrc <owner>/<repo>      # GitHub repo (e.g., npx opensrc vercel/ai)
```

## Kleis Project Charter

This repository is building a **single OAuth account proxy** for coding agents.

### Problem Statement

One user can have multiple OAuth-backed accounts across Copilot, Codex, and Claude.
Re-authenticating these accounts in every client and every machine is painful.

### Product Goal

Provide one reusable base URL that:

- accepts admin-managed API keys,
- stores OAuth credentials centrally,
- refreshes tokens automatically,
- exposes model discovery endpoints,
- routes requests to Copilot/Codex/Claude accounts,
- includes a minimal admin UI for account operations.

### Primary Use Case

- OpenCode compatibility first.
- Other coding agents should work via OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible endpoints.

### Required Provider Behavior

- **Copilot**: first-party OAuth flow should work without workaround hacks.
- **Codex**: first-party OAuth flow should work without workaround hacks.
- **Claude**: include workaround patterns used in:
  - `opensrc/repos/github.com/anomalyco/opencode-anthropic-auth`
  - `opensrc/repos/github.com/badlogic/pi-mono`

For Claude OAuth behavior in this project:

- include required beta headers,
- include Claude Code user-agent/system identity behavior,
- include request/stream tool-name normalization patterns,
- do **not** hide this behind a feature flag.

### Deployment and Runtime Decisions

- Build **Vercel-first** architecture.
- Keep route/service boundaries portable to other runtimes.
- Use **Hono + Vercel Functions** for implementation.

### Data and ORM Decisions

- Use **Turso (libSQL)** as the relational database.
- Use **Drizzle ORM** + Drizzle migrations for schema and queries.
- Keep all request/response and env contracts fully typed.

### Storage Decisions

- Use a database for persistence (tokens, accounts, API keys, OAuth state).
- Plaintext token storage is acceptable for this personal project.
- No encryption/hashing required right now.

### Simplicity and Maintainability Rules

- Keep modules small and explicit.
- Avoid duplicate provider logic by sharing small utilities.
- Prefer straightforward control flow over clever abstractions.
- Keep the admin UI minimal and functional.
- Build only what is needed for v1.

### Model Registry Requirements

- Provide endpoint(s) compatible with OpenCode model discovery.
- Merge custom proxy models with latest `models.dev` data.
- Keep `models.dev` data fresh by fetching upstream.
- Expose a models.dev-compatible JSON route that OpenCode can consume directly.

### Admin UI Requirements (v1)

- view all configured accounts,
- set primary account per provider,
- issue/revoke API keys,
- trigger token refresh manually,
- show last refresh state.

### Immediate Non-Goals

- advanced telemetry,
- billing, quotas, monetization,
- enterprise-grade multi-tenant security,
- over-designed dashboards.
